# Let's dive deeper into the ES7/ES2016 proposals and features.

---

## `Array.prototype.includes`

---


### `Array.prototype.includes` is a replacement for `Array.prototype.indexOf(...)>-1` which developers used to check for presence of a value in an array.

---

In ES6:

```js
let arr = ['react', 'angular', 'vue']

// WRONG
if (arr.indexOf('react')) { // 0 -> evaluates to false, definitely as we expected
  console.log('Can use React') // this line would never be executed
}

// Correct
if (arr.indexOf('react') !== -1) {
  console.log('Can use React')
}
```

---

Or a little bit hacky bitwise NOT operator `~` to make the code more compact since `~` (bitwise NOTing) against any number is equivalent to `-(a + 1)`:

```js
let arr = ['react', 'angular', 'vue']

// Correct
if (~arr.indexOf('react')) {
  console.log('Can use React')
}
```

---

The ES7 code with `includes` would be:

```js
let arr = ['react', 'angular', 'vue']

// Correct
if (arr.includes('react')) {
  console.log('Can use React')
}
```

---

Developers can also use `includes` with strings:

```js
let str = 'React Quickly'

// Correct
if (str.toLowerCase().includes('react')) {  // true
  console.log('Found "react"')  
}
```

---

### Interestingly, many JavaScript libraries already had `includes` or similarly working `contains` (but TC39 decided not to use name contains [because of MooTools](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/having-a-non-enumerable-array-prototype-contains-may-not-be-web-compatible)).

---

Some other (older) includes:

* jQuery: [`$.inArray`](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.inarray)
* Underscore.js: [`_.contains`](http://underscorejs.org/#contains)
* Lodash: [`_.includes`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.3#includes) (and in version 3 and earlier, `_.contains`, just like in Underscore)
* CoffeeScript: `in` operator ([example](http://bit.ly/2jGxfaL))
* Dart: `list.contains` ([example](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b8e39109e5705a9a0ff7281c1af97195))

---

### In addition to being more eloquent and actually giving developers the boolean value instead of position of a match, `includes` also works with `NaN` (not a number).

---

### Finally, `includes` has `fromIndex` second optional parameter. This is good for optimization, because it allows to look for a match starting at a certain position.

---

More examples:

```js
console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(2)) // === true)
console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(4)) // === false)

console.log([1, 2, NaN].includes(NaN)) // === true)

console.log([1, 2, -0].includes(+0)) // === true)
console.log([1, 2, +0].includes(-0)) // === true)

console.log(['a', 'b', 'c'].includes('a')) // === true)
console.log(['a', 'b', 'c'].includes('a', 1)) // === false)
```

---

### Note: `indexOf()` is still useful when you need an exact index (position) of the match, not just true/false value whether it exists or not.

---

### All in all, `includes` brings simplicity to any developer who has to check if a value is in an array/list... which is like almost all of us. Rejoice!

---

## Exponentiation Operator

---

### This operator is mostly for developers doing some math and is useful in case of 3D, Virtual Reality, SVG or data visualization.

---


So in ES6/ES2015, you can use `Math.pow` or create a small recursive arrow function:

```js
calculateExponent = (base, exponent) => base*((--exponent>1)?calculateExponent(base, exponent):base)
console.log(calculateExponent(7,12) === Math.pow(7,12)) // true
console.log(calculateExponent(2,7) === Math.pow(2,7)) // true
```

^In ES6 and prior, you had to either create a loop, create a recursive function or use [`Math.pow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow). If you forgot what exponent is, it's when you multiply the same number (base) over itself many times (exponent). For example, 7 power of 3 is `7 * 7 * 7`.

---

Now in ES7/ES2016, math-oriented developers can use shorter syntax:

```js
let a = 7 ** 12
let b = 2 ** 7
console.log(a === Math.pow(7,12)) // true
console.log(b === Math.pow(2,7)) // true
```

---

Developers also can use operation assignment:

```js
let a = 7
a **= 12
let b = 2
b **= 7
console.log(a === Math.pow(7,12)) // true
console.log(b === Math.pow(2,7)) // true
```

---

Many new ES features are borrowed from other languages (CoffeeScript - love it, Ruby, etc.) As you can guess, exponential operator exists in other languages:

* Python: `x ** y`
* CoffeeScript: `x ** y`
* F#: `x ** y`
* Ruby: `x ** y`
* Perl: `x ** y`
* Lua, Basic, MATLAB: `x ^ y`

---

### Not having an exponential operator in JavaScript was never a problem for me personally. :)

I never wrote anything exponential in my 15 years of writing JavaScript besides interviews and coding tutorials like this one... Was the lack of an exponential operator a big miss for you?

---

### That's all for ES7 features. :-)
